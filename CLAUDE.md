# Vibecode Academy

## Project Overview

This is the marketing site and resources for Vibecode Academy — a coaching service teaching founders, executives, and teams how to build with AI (specifically Claude Code).

**Owner:** Vedran  
**Location:** Zürich, Switzerland  
**Target audience:** Tech-savvy executives, startup founders, dev teams

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Static HTML/CSS/JS (no framework, keep it simple)
- **Hosting:** TBD (likely Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages)
- **Forms:** TBD (Tally, Formspree, or simple mailto)

## Project Structure

```
/
├── index.html          # Main landing page
├── docs/               # Session plans, cheatsheets, resources
├── assets/             # Images, fonts if self-hosted
└── CLAUDE.md           # This file
```

## Design Principles

- Dark, premium aesthetic (not generic SaaS look)
- Monospace + serif font pairing (JetBrains Mono + Instrument Serif)
- Accent color: cyan (#22d3ee)
- Minimal, no bloat — this is a one-person service, not a startup

## Content Guidelines

- Direct, confident tone — no hedging or corporate speak
- Focus on outcomes: "ship faster", "build real things", "immediate results"
- Swiss market context — prices in CHF, Zürich-based

## Current Offerings

1. **Executive 1:1** — CHF 500 / 2 hours
2. **Team Workshop** — CHF 2,500 / half-day
3. **Ongoing Advisory** — CHF 1,500 / month

## TODO

- [ ] Add real testimonial after Michael's session
- [ ] Set up form backend
- [ ] Add privacy policy / impressum (Swiss requirement)
- [ ] Consider adding case studies page later
- [ ] Maybe a /resources page with free content to build trust

## Notes for Claude

When working on this project:
- Keep the design cohesive — don't introduce new colors or fonts
- Prioritize performance — no heavy frameworks
- Swiss German market = professional but not stuffy
- Vedran prefers clean, well-commented code
