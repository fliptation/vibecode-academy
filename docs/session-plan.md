# Vibecode Intro Session
## 2-Hour Executive Workshop for Michael (CEO, Cashare)

---

### Pre-Session (5 min before)

**Setup check:**
- Claude Code installed and authenticated
- VS Code or terminal ready
- A real mini-project from Cashare to work on (ideal) or a prepared demo project
- Screen share working

---

### Hour 1: Foundations

#### 0:00–0:10 · The Mental Model
**Goal:** Shift from "AI as autocomplete" to "AI as junior dev you're pair programming with"

- The vibecoding mindset: you're the architect, Claude is the builder
- Why prompting well is a skill (not just typing)
- Quick demo: bad prompt vs good prompt → show the difference in output quality
- "Garbage in, garbage out" — but also: "context in, magic out"

#### 0:10–0:30 · Your First Build (Hands-On)
**Goal:** Get Michael typing, not watching

Pick a small, real task. Options:
- A landing page for a Cashare feature
- A simple internal tool (calculator, form, dashboard widget)
- A script to automate something tedious

Walk through:
1. **Starting the conversation** — how to give Claude context about the project
2. **The first prompt** — structure: what, why, constraints, examples
3. **Reading the output** — what to look for, how to evaluate
4. **Iterating** — "make it more...", "actually, change X to Y", "add error handling"

Key teaching moments:
- Show how to break big requests into smaller chunks
- Demonstrate the "yes, and" approach vs starting over
- Point out when Claude needs more context vs when it's just wrong

#### 0:30–0:50 · The Review Loop
**Goal:** Build judgment — when to trust, when to verify

- Reading AI-generated code: the 30-second scan
- Red flags to watch for (hallucinated APIs, outdated patterns, security issues)
- How to ask Claude to explain its own code
- Testing in small increments — run early, run often
- The "teach me what this does" technique

**Hands-on:** Have Michael review and critique something Claude wrote. Practice asking good follow-up questions.

#### 0:50–1:00 · Break + Q&A Buffer

### Hour 2: Real Workflow

#### 1:00–1:20 · Project Setup & Configuration
**Goal:** Set Michael up for success beyond this session

- CLAUDE.md files: giving Claude persistent context about your project
- Hooks: auto-formatting, linting, pre-commit checks
- Custom instructions: your preferences, baked in
- Quick tour of useful flags and options

**Hands-on:** Create a CLAUDE.md for Cashare (or a sample project). Add a hook.

#### 1:20–1:40 · Building Something Real
**Goal:** End with something Michael can show off

Spend 20 minutes building something complete:
- Could be an internal dashboard
- Could be a customer-facing component
- Could be a utility script

Practice the full loop:
1. Plan → 2. Prompt → 3. Review → 4. Refine → 5. Ship

Encourage Michael to drive. Coach from the side. Let mistakes happen — they're teaching moments.

#### 1:40–1:55 · Advanced Patterns (Overview)
**Goal:** Show what's possible, plant seeds for future learning

Quick demos / explanations of:
- **Multi-file projects:** how to help Claude understand your codebase
- **MCP servers:** connecting Claude to external tools (databases, APIs, Slack)
- **Agentic loops:** letting Claude run and iterate autonomously
- **Testing with AI:** generating tests, test-driven prompting

No need to go deep — just show that there's more to explore.

#### 1:55–2:00 · Wrap-Up

- Recap the 3 key takeaways
- Share resources:
  - Anthropic's Claude Code docs
  - Prompting best practices cheatsheet
  - Your contact for follow-up questions
- Ask: "What's the first thing you're going to build with this?"
- Offer: "Text me in a week — I want to hear what you shipped"

### Post-Session Deliverables

Send within 24 hours:
1. **Session recording** (if recorded)
2. **Cheatsheet:** One-pager of key prompting patterns
3. **Starter CLAUDE.md template** customized for Cashare
4. **Curated reading list** (3–5 links max)

### Notes for Vedran

**Pacing tips:**
- If Michael is moving fast → go deeper on advanced patterns
- If he's struggling → spend more time on basics, cut the overview section
- Always prioritize hands-on time over explanation

**Potential friction points:**
- Auth issues with Claude Code → have backup plan
- "This feels like cheating" → address the mindset directly
- Perfectionism / wanting to understand everything → remind him shipping > perfecting

**Success metrics:**
- Michael builds at least one complete thing during the session
- He leaves with a working setup (Claude Code + CLAUDE.md + hooks)
- He sends you something he built within 7 days (unprompted)

### Pricing Context

**This session:** CHF 500 (introductory rate for first client)

**What to mention:**
> "I'm testing this format with a few founders before I scale it up. Your feedback is valuable — if this lands, I'll likely raise the price. But for early clients, I want it to be a no-brainer."

*Good luck. He's going to love it.*
